Just my personal nvim config. Don't use this.

It's just [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) with some plugins

# Installation
1. [Install neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#appimage-universal-linux-package) (Hint: **Do not** use the apt package - instead install the appimage directly)
2. Ensure `gopls` is installed. If not, install it by executing `go install -v golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest`
3. Clone this repo into `~/.config/nvim`
4. Start neovim using `nvim` ðŸš€
